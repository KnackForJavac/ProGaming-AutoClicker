# ProGaming-AutoClicker
ProGaming-AutoClicker was made mainly for gamers, but I don't care what you use it for.
Me being a casual gamer decided it was time for a new project, something to boost my gaming maybe. I skimmed through some mod tutorials, but none of them seemed right for me.
I decided to go with an auto-clicker, which, knowing nothing about one, I donwloaded one. I tested the one I downloaded, and soon I got the basics down.
